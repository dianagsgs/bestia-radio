This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Then edited
by Diana GS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server for the frontend:

```bash
npm run next-dev
```

Then, run the development server for the backend:

```bash
npm run flask-dev
```

You can also run both dev servers concurrently with 
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Note that the backend is running in port 5000.

You can start editing the page by modifying the files in the components, pages, and
styles folders. The page auto-updates as you edit each file.
The backend can be configured by editing the pages in the api folder. The backend is
using the Flask framework.
